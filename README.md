# fruit-image-classification
A deep learning project to classify fruit images using CNN and the Fruits-360 dataset.

# üçé Fruit Image Classification using CNN ‚Äì Computer Vision Project
# üîç Project Overview
This project involves building an image classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to recognize various types of fruits from images. The dataset used is the Fruits-360 dataset, a popular benchmark for practicing image classification and computer vision tasks.

The entire pipeline ‚Äî from loading data and preprocessing to model building, training, and evaluation ‚Äî is implemented using Python, TensorFlow/Keras, OpenCV, and Matplotlib, in a Jupyter Notebook environment.

# üß† Skills & Technologies Demonstrated
Computer Vision: Used OpenCV for image loading, visualization, and manipulation.

Deep Learning: Built and trained a CNN using Keras for multi-class image classification.

Data Handling: Unzipped and organized dataset programmatically from Google Drive.

Image Augmentation: Applied ImageDataGenerator to enhance model robustness and reduce overfitting.

Model Evaluation: Visualized predictions and evaluated model performance using metrics like accuracy.

 # üìÅ Key Features
Reads and preprocesses high-resolution fruit images (100x100 px).

Visualizes image samples to confirm data integrity.

Applies CNNs for feature extraction and classification.

Supports scalable training via image generators.

Easily modifiable architecture for further experimentation.
